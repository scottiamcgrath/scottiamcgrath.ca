    I want to define two functions with a single equation. By that, I mean that if you were to plot the final equation, you would see both of the original curves. This, as far as I'm aware, has no practical use. I just think it's cool. It turns out this is possible under some restrictions.
</p>
<p>
    Take two arbitrary functions $F, G: x \rightarrow y$. We can construct a surface containing both functions. To do this, take the equation for a circle in the $zy$ plane:
    \begin{equation} 
        (z-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2
    \end{equation}
    where $h$ is the circle's displacement along the $z$-axis and $k$ is the circle's displacement along the $y$-axis. We can give values of $h$, $k$, and $r$ such that the circle always passes through both functions. For this, $h=0$, $k$ is the average value of both functions $k=\frac{F+G}{2}$, and $r$ is the modulus of half of the difference between the functions $r=\left|{\frac{F-G}{2}}\right|$. Substituting these values of $h$, $k$, and $r$ into equation 1, we have our surface.
    \begin{equation} 
        z^2 + \left(y-\frac{F+G}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\left|{\frac{F-G}{2}}\right|\right)^2
    \end{equation}
    As our functions $F$ and $G$ are bounded within the $xy$ plane, we are only interested in the solutions where $z=0$. Substituting this value for $z$ into equation 2, we have:
    \begin{equation} 
        \left(y-\frac{F+G}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\left|{\frac{F-G}{2}}\right|\right)^2
    \end{equation}
    Finally, we can solve equation 3 for $y$ to obtain a general formula for an equation of two functions.
    \begin{equation} 
        y = \frac{F+G}{2} \pm \frac{F-G}{2}
    \end{equation}
    So that it is easier to refer to later, we can give the $y$ in equation 4 a new symbol.
    \begin{equation} 
        Q = \frac{F+G}{2} \pm \frac{F-G}{2}
    \end{equation}
    For an example of how this works, we can solve for $Q$ for the functions $F=sinx$ and $G=e^{-x}$. In the below figure, the left plot shows a plot of $F$ and $G$ while the right plot shows a plot of $Q$.

<p>
    As you can see, the plots are the same. There are limitations though. The big one is that $F$ and $G$ must be defined on the same domain. In regions where $F$ or $G$ are undefined, $Q$ will also be undefined. Thus, in regions where $F$ is defined and $G$ is not, $Q$ will not reproduce $F$ and visa versa. This is demonstrated in the figure below by plotting $F = 3\frac{sinx}{x}$, $G = +\sqrt{x + 1}$, and the respective $Q$.

    These plots are not the same.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, $F$ and $G$ must be functions. It's unclear how we would construct the surface we used to derive equation 5 in non-functional cases. As a consequence of this, in the above figure, $G$ was defined $G = +\sqrt{x + 1}$. $G$ was defined as positive because $G = \sqrt{x}$ is not a function.
</p>
<p>
    Another problem is that, $F$ and $G$ must be defined under the same mapping. If we define $F: x \rightarrow y$ and $G: w \rightarrow z$, we need to define how $w, x, y,$ and $z$ relate before we can construct our surface.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, equation 5 only works for two inputs $F$ and $G$. It would be much cooler to expand this concept to enable the definition of an arbitrary number of functions with a single equation.
</p>
<p>
    These are all interesting problems and, if I make additional maths posts, they will probably be on these problems.
