    <B>Ethics??? choose a better title later</B>

  For now, I'm just going to outline the argument with bullet points below.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When we first make an ethical theory, we have to answer the following questions.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do ethical values actually exist?
        <ul>
          $b$
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Yes, undeniably so. Genocide is bad. It wracks at our souls. We have to call that fact something, and we call it ethics. This does not prove anything about ethics, just that it exists. Notice though, this proof is dependant on the existance of people. Without people, ethics may still exist, but it's a lot harder to prove it (I can't do so). To distinguish between these two possible forms of ethics, we can call ethics which is dependant on people existing "people-ethics" and ethics which is independant of people "universal-ethics." These can be thought of as two parts of a singular ethics.
            <ul>
              One Additional proof you can do is that person-ethics is independant of uiniversal-ethics. That is to say that, If universal-ethics exists, person-ethics can also exist. This is important because the above proof only shows that an ethics exists, it does not distinguish between which one exists. This can also be done quite easily. 
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        If so:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Why do those ethical values exist?
            I have to somehow explain interpersonal ethics as more than random. Hating black people is wrong. This can be done by saying that while cultural ethics is largely arbitray, it is bounded by convergent instrumental goals. Interpersonal ethics must then follow the cultural norms. Not sure if this is circular though as the convergent instrumental goals are built out of individual relations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where do ethical values come from?
          </li>
          <li>
            What are those ethical values
          </li>
          <li>
            Who do those ethical values apply to? (When as well because I know they have the same answer)
          </li>
          <li>
            How do we achieve these values/ What is the algorithm?
          </li>
          <li>
            which
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    We can then construct these answers into an argument for a specific formulation of ethics.
  </li>
</ul>
